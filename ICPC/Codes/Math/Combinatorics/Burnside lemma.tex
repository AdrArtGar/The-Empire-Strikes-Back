Burnside's lemma is a result in group theory that can help when counting objects with symmetry taken into account. It gives a formula to count objects, where two objects that are related by a symmetry (rotation or reflection, for example) are not to be counted as distinct.

let $G$ be a finite group. For each $g$ in $G$ let $f(g)$ denote the set of elements that are fixed by $g$.

\begin{gather*}
  |classes| = \frac{1}{|G|} \cdot \sum_{g \in G} f(g)  
\end{gather*}
