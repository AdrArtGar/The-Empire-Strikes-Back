  \item Longest Common Substring of various strings \\
  Add \emph{notUsed} characters between strings, i.e. $a + \$ + b + \# + c$ \\ 
  Use two-pointers to find a range $[l, r]$ such that all \emph{notUsed} characters are present, then $query(lcp[l + 1],..,lcp[r])$ for that window is the common length. \\
