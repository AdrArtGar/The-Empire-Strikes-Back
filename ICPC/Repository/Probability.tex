\nsection{Probability}

\subsection{Conditional} 
The event A happens and the event B has already happened
\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \] \\
If \textbf{independent} events
\[ P(A|B) = P(A) , P(B|A) = P(B) \]

\subsection{Bayes theorem}
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{ P(B | A) \cdot P(A) }{ P(B) } \]

\subsection{Binomial}
\[ B = {n \choose x} \cdot p^{x} \cdot (1 - p)^{n-x} \]
$n$	=	number of trials \\
$x$	=	number of \textbf{success} from $n$ trials \\
$p$	=	probability of \textbf{success} on a single trial


\subsection{Geometric}
Probability of success at the $nth$-event after failing the others
\[ G = (1 - p)^{n - 1} \cdot p \]
$n$	=	number of trials \\
$p$	=	probability of \emph{success} on a single trial


\subsection{Poisson}
\[ Po = \frac{\lambda ^ k \cdot e ^ {-\lambda}}{k!} \]
$\lambda$ = number of times an event is expected (occurs / time)  \\
$k$ = number of occurring events in the limited period of time \\

Example: The event happens 4 times per minute and we want $k$ events to happen in 10 minutes, then $\lambda = 4 \cdot 10 = 40$

\subsection{Expected value}
\[ E_x = \sum_{\forall x} x \cdot p(x) \]
